I'll read the repo's Supabase client/server files to extract the exact environment variable names and any special build/runtime notes so I can give precise, copy-paste deployment instructions for a free host (Vercel). I'll fetch three files now and report back with the env names and next steps. I'll fetch the project's package.json, next.config.mjs, and README.md to confirm build scripts, Node engine, and any deployment notes so I can give exact Vercel/Supabase steps. Expecting to extract the build command and any special settings. I'll fetch three files now. I'll prepare a short, actionable guide to deploy this Next.js + Supabase app to free hosting (Vercel) and set up the free Supabase project and required environment variables; below I list the checklist I used and then give step-by-step instructions.

Checklist (requirements inferred)
- Deploy the Next.js app using a free host (Vercel). — Done (instructions)
- Provide exact env var names used by the app. — Done (extracted from repo)
- Create a free Supabase project and run DB schema. — Done (instructions)
- Connect Clerk auth keys (project needs Clerk). — Done (instructions)
- Explain how to set GEMINI API key (optional/Google AI). — Done (notes)
- Show quick verification steps (build + DB check). — Done (commands)

Quick repo scan (progress)
- Read client.ts, server.ts, supabase-verify.ts, package.json, next.config.mjs, and README.md to extract env names and build script.
- Found build script: `npm run build` (uses Next.js).
- Found required environment variables (see below).
What's next: follow the step-by-step instructions to create Supabase + Clerk projects, run migrations, set env vars in Vercel, and deploy.

Required environment variables (from the repo / README)
- NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL
- NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
- NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY
- CLERK_SECRET_KEY
- GEMINI_API_KEY (optional — Google Gemini / AI Studio key for Gemini integration)

Step-by-step: deploy on Vercel (free) — minimal, copy-paste ready

1) Push your repo to GitHub (or Git provider)
- Create a repo on GitHub and push your local project.
Example (PowerShell):
```powershell
git init
git add .
git commit -m "initial"
git remote add origin https://github.com/youruser/your-repo.git
git push -u origin main
```

2) Create a free Supabase project
- Go to https://app.supabase.com and sign up.
- Create a new project (free tier).
- In the Supabase dashboard -> Settings -> API you will find:
  - Project URL -> set as `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
  - anon/public key -> set as `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`

3) Run database schema / migrations
- Open the Supabase SQL editor and run the SQL in `sql/001_init.sql` from the repo to create the required tables.
- Quick verification: you can run the provided verify script locally (needs Node + env set). Example (PowerShell):
  - Create .env.local with the two Supabase values.
  - Run:
```powershell
npm install
node --version  # make sure Node is recent (recommended >= 18)
npx ts-node scripts/supabase-verify.ts
# or compile/run via ts-node if installed; otherwise run a tiny JS test
```
(If you can't run TypeScript directly, paste the SQL test into Supabase SQL editor instead — the script just does a sample select/insert to check connectivity.)

4) Create Clerk project (for auth)
- Sign up at https://clerk.com and create a project (free tier available).
- Obtain:
  - Publishable key -> `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`
  - Secret key -> `CLERK_SECRET_KEY`
- Configure allowed origins/redirect URLs in Clerk to include your Vercel domain (you can add them later after deployment).

5) (Optional) Get GEMINI_API_KEY
- If you want Google Gemini features, follow README instructions (Google AI Studio) to create an API key and set `GEMINI_API_KEY`. Note: Gemini/Google APIs may require billing; check Google docs — if you don’t have a key, the app may still run but features relying on Gemini will be disabled.

6) Deploy to Vercel
- Go to https://vercel.com and log in (free plan).
- "Import Project" -> choose Git provider -> select your repo.
- Framework preset should detect Next.js automatically.
- Build Command: leave as default (Vercel will run `npm run build`) or set `npm run build`.
- Environment variables: add the variables you gathered:
  - For Production (and Preview if you want tests), add:
    - NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL
    - NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
    - NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY
    - CLERK_SECRET_KEY
    - GEMINI_API_KEY (optional)
- Deploy. Vercel will build and publish your site.

7) Post-deploy checks
- Visit the deployed domain (Vercel provides it).
- Test sign-up/sign-in (Clerk) and create a chat to ensure DB writes show up in Supabase.
- If things fail, check Vercel build logs and serverless function logs for missing env vars or errors.

Quick local verification before deploying
- Create .env.local at repo root with the collected vars:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=<your-supabase-url>
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<your-anon-key>
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=<your-clerk-pub>
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=<your-clerk-secret>
GEMINI_API_KEY=<optional-gemini-key>
```
- Install deps and build:
```powershell
npm install
npm run build
npm run dev  # for local testing
```

Notes, caveats and tips
- The app exposes Supabase keys as NEXT_PUBLIC_* — that's how the repo is built. The anon key is meant to be public for client-side usage. Keep the secret keys (Clerk secret) server-side only (do not prefix with NEXT_PUBLIC).
- The Gemini API may require billing on the Google side; you can skip it to deploy the app but AI-powered features may be limited or disabled.
- If you need to run server-side scripts (like background tasks), Vercel serverless functions are cold-started—this app appears standard Next.js and should run fine on Vercel.
- If you prefer alternatives: Netlify (Next support via adapter) or Render; Vercel is the fastest path for Next.js.

Requirements coverage
- Deploy app to free host: Done (Vercel instructions)
- Env var names and where to get them: Done (listed + where to find)
- Supabase DB creation: Done (run `sql/001_init.sql` in Supabase SQL editor)
- Clerk setup: Done (instructions)
- Gemini API note: Done (optional + billing caveat)

If you want, I can:
- Generate a checklist with clickable links for each step.
- Create a minimal `vercel.json` or example `README-deploy.md` in the repo with the exact env var keys and commands.
- Walk through configuring Clerk allowed origins for your deployed domain.

Which of those would you like me to do next?
